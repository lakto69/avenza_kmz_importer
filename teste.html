<p>When we import KML/KMZ files into QGIS, the symbology of the features they carry is not preserved.</p><p>Icons, colors, thicknesses, opacities, etc., which may have been used, during the creation of each feature, to visually communicate some important characteristic of it, end up unused because the symbology is not preserved.</p><p>With this plugin, all features are grouped within the layers created in Avenza and, within each layer, separate groups are created by geometry type (Point, Line and Polygon) and, within the geometry, they are categorized by their style characteristics symbology, visually facilitating geographic analysis.</p><p>Point features are imported using the same icons available in the <a href="https://store.avenza.com/">Avenza Maps App</a>.</p><p>The Tracks that were created in Avenza will be added to QGIS in two geometry groups: <b>Line</b> and <b>Point</b>. The points layer contains all the data for each point on that track in its attribute table: <i>speed, when, angles, horizontal_accuracy,</i> etc. And it uses a <img src="svg/dot-and-circle.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="Target"> as an icon.</p><p><b>WARNING:</b> This plugin was specifically developed to import KML and KMZ files <mark>exported by Avenza</mark>. <ins>It probably won't work with other KML/KMZ files created by other applications!</ins></p>
