about=This plugin is used to import features from KML and KMZ files exported by the App <a href="https://store.avenza.com/">Avenza Maps</a>, maintaining the original icons of the points created in that application and categorizing all features by the style of the original symbology. WARNING: It was developed to specifically import KML and KMZ files exported by Avenza. It probably won't work with other KML/KMZ files created by other applications!
